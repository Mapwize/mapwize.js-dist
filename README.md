# Mapwize.js

This is the Mapwize Javascript SDK. 

The SDK allows you to:

- Display the map of buildings, with all floors and places.
- Add your own data on the map.
- Locate the user inside the building.
- Display directions between 2 points, across multiple floors.

## Access to the platform

To get your access to the platform (API and back-end interface), please register on [mapwize.io](https://www.mapwize.io)

Registration is required before you can use the SDK. But it's free!

## Leaflet plugin

The SDK is built as a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) plugin. Leaflet is included in the package so you don't have to worry about importing it. Mapwize.js is all you need.

The package is exposed both in `L.Mapwize` and simply as `Mapwize`.

## Demo

Some demos are available in the demo folder. Demos are stand-alone html files that can be opened inside a web browser.

## Documentation

The documentation regarding the use of the SDK is available within the doc folder.
